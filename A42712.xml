         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle to the READER.</head>
            <p>FRiend, It is in true tenderneſs deſired of thee, in thy read ng of this following Teſtimony, to turn thy mind unto that meaſure of the good Spirit of God which he hath placed in thee to inſtruct thee, that thou thereby may be inſtructed in the reading of it; for it is that onely which doth give unto man the knowledge of the things of God; and as man joyns unto this in his heart, this gives unto him the ſight of the things of Gods Kingdom, and to taſte and ſavour the things that are of God, which while his minde is out from this of God in him, he can never have the true ſight of, nor taſte, nor ſavour the things that be of God; but thou coming to this, it will cool and ſettle thy mind inwardly, ſo that thou may read in coolneſs and ſtilneſs of mind, without any prejudice, anger, or byaſſedneſs in thy mind; and ſo if thou thus come to read, thou may come to receive benefit in that which thou doſt read, and if thou ſo do, then my deſire is anſwered, and my ſoul therein refreſhed; and if it come ſo to paſs, my ſoul ſhall give the glory unto God, who hath taught me thoſe things which I have written unto thee; and I do deſire that thou alſo may give him the glory, if thou do receive any benefit, for unto him it doth belong for ever.</p>
            <p>And this I do ſay unto thee, in the pure fear of my God, that thoſe things which I have written in this following Teſtimony, he hath taught me by his Spirit, which he hath given me to inſtruct me, which while my mind was out from it, and I did not believe in it, thoſe things which I have here written was hid from me, and in that ſtate of unbelief I was as dark, and ſpiritually blind as others.</p>
            <p>Although I could talk much of God and Chriſt, yet I knew them not, nor the Heavenly things; I did read of God and Chriſt in the holy Scriptures, but I did neither know God, Chriſt, nor the
<pb facs="tcp:106803:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Scriptures, until I came to believe in the Spirit of God which he hath given me to inſtruct me; and ſince I came to believe in him, and to depend on him for teaching, he hath revealed great things unto me as it is written, <hi>The ſecrets of the Lord are with them that fear him</hi> and it is written, <hi>That it is the Lord that teacheth his people to profit and I will teach my people my ſelf ſaith God, I will write my Law in their hearts and minds, and they ſhall no more need to ſay one unto another know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the greateſt of them unto the leaſt of them, and I will be mercifull unto their ſins: and I will remember their iniquities no more;</hi> he here ſpeaketh of thoſe ſins which is committed in time of unbelief, that when any man or woman cometh to believe in his Son Chriſt Jeſus the Light, whom he hath given for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, and followeth his Son the Light, whom he hath given for a Leader and Commander, to command man to forſake the Devils works, (which is ſin) and to lead him out of the Devils work, which is ſin; when man yeilds and ſubmits unto Chriſt Gods Power revealed and made manifeſt in his inward parts, for to lead out of ſin, and to deſtroy it, and to bind and caſt him out who is the Author of it, then God forgives and forgets thoſe ſins and iniquities, for his Son Chriſt Jeſus his ſake, in whom they have believed; and ſo they have their ſins forgiven them for his Name ſake, in whom they have believed, and unto whom they have ſubmitted, and by whoſe Wiſdom they are led and guided into thoſe things which is well-pleaſing in the ſight of the Lord God; and thus he becomes the way to God the Father unto every ſinfull man or woman, that comes to believe in him, and faithfully to follow him, and thus he becomes the Author of Eternal Salvation unto every one that doth believe in, and obey him; and thus he comes to help man, as it is written, <hi>Help is laid on one that is mighty to ſave;</hi> and certainly, Reader, his Might and great Power hath been received in this preſent Age wherein we live, unto a little Remnant, whoſe minds have been turned within, to wait in the Light wherewith he hath enlightened them, the ſtrong man of ſin, the Prince of the power of the air, who in dayes paſt kept the houſe, kept the heart, kept the mind of men and women, and did exerciſe them in thoſe things which was abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, he hath been made to bow, and tremble, and fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of God in the heart of man, which Son and Power of God is greater and ſtronger then he (who was glorified with the
<pb facs="tcp:106803:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Father before the World began that heth in wickedneſs, which he is the God of who hath blinded their minds that is given up to ſerve him, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel ſhould ſhine into their hearts, and leſt by this Light he ſhould be diſcovered, and his works deſtroyed, he doth labour all that he can to keep people from believing in this true Light, Chriſt, who hath enlightened every one that is come into the World: But I ſay there is a Remnant who hath believed in Chriſt the Light, and they have felt him the great and mighty power of God, to make this ſtrong Man of Sin to bow, and he is caſt down, and out, who once did ſit in the Temple that God did create for himſelf to dwell in, even above all that is truly called God: and in a little Remnant the Lord God hath recovered his own Right, and he now doth reign whoſe right it is, and the Government is upon his ſhoulders, and under his Government we do ſit with great delight, and his Fruit is ſweet unto our taſte; and this is the Name which we can truly, and experimentally call him, <hi>The Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> for he is truly ſo, who hath redeemed us out of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: and thus God the Father hath made his Son Chriſt Jeſus unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption; and thus we who ſometimes were Forreigners and Strangers from God, are now brought near unto him; and we that were in dayes paſt darkneſs, are now made light in the Lord; and we who in times paſt was dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, hath he now quickned; and thus God hath made his Son Chriſt Jeſus the Captain of our Salvation, and the Biſhop of our Souls; and we that were once wandered, and gone aſtray in our imaginations into divers and ſundry Forms of worſhip, he hath now gathered us out of thoſe various Forms, where we were ſcattered in our imaginations; and we have now found that within us, which we had long been looking for without us, amongſt the falſe Prophets which Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, and that they ſhould deceive many; and he ſaid, <hi>They ſhall ſay, Lo here is Chriſt:</hi> but Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Go ye not forth.</hi> Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider, that Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, before he was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem, I am the Vine, ye are the Branches, as the Branches cannot bring forth fruit, except they abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me: and without me ye can do nothing:</hi> they were in a meaſure in him, and he in them, while as he did walk with them in that viſible appearance which he after did ſuffer in; and ſo it was good wholſom Doctrine that he did preach
<pb facs="tcp:106803:4"/>unto them, when he ſaid, <hi>They ſhall ſay, Lo here is Chriſt, and lo there is Chriſt, believe them not, go not forth;</hi> for that of Chriſt which they were come to know, and their minds was brought in unto, that was it which was ſufficient to give them the knowledge of thoſe ſalfe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which Chriſt foretold them of, that they ſhould come in his Name: and therefore it was very neceſſary that he ſhould exhort them to keep within with it; and this meaſure which they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the belief of, and feeling of, before his departure, in that only, and in nothing elſe could they know him, and receive him in his coming again unto them, who ſaid, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs, I and my Father we will come and make our abode with you:</hi> and they waited at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> until this bleſſed promiſe was fulfilled, in them, who was endued with Chriſt, Gods power from on high; ſo they were Gods Temples and God and Chriſt did walk in them according to his promiſe.</p>
            <p>But now we who have our being in this Age wherein the Whore, the falſe Church hath ſitten as a Queen, and hath riden upon the ſcarlet coloured Beaſt, who hath received his Power, and Seat, and great Authority from the Dragon, darkneſs hath covered the Earth, and thick darkneſs hath covered us the people; and ſo we were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the power of darkneſs, and ſo was hurled up and down with the falſe Prophets Doctrine, and was deceived by their fained words, and fair ſpeeches, with which they did lye in wait for that purpoſe; and ſo we were long learning of them, but was never able to come to the knowledge of the true God, nor of his true worſhip by all their teachings; and ſo Phyſitians of no value we have found them to be.</p>
            <p>But as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to open the eye of the mind, which the God of the World had blinded, by turning peoples minds from that dark power that led them into ſin, unto the Light and Power of Chriſt in them, which did condemn for ſin, by which they did witneſs redemption from ſin.</p>
            <p>So the Lord God hath raiſed up ſome in this preſent Age, in the ſame work, to turn peoples minds in unto the Light, that thereby they may receive the knowledge of God, and of his pare worſhip which is in his own Spirit and Truth, which the Devil and Sin is out of, and the labours and travels of ſuch as he doth ſend forth, in his own Power and Wiſdom, is very effectual and prevalent in a Remnant, to turn them unto God: ſo that thouſands that walked in darkneſs
<pb facs="tcp:106803:4"/>up and down amongſt the falſe Prophets, and knew not whether they went, becauſe the Prince of darkneſs had blinded their minds, is now turned unto God who is Light, and now they are Light in him, as they were darkneſs in the power of darkneſs, ſo now they are Light in the Power of God, who is Light, and in whom there is no darkneſs at all.</p>
            <p>So, as I ſaid before, that which we were ſeeking without us amongſt the falſe Prophets, who have cryed, Lo here, Lo there, that we have found within us, Glory, yea, glory to the Lord God for evermore; for it is his own work, and let it glorifie him.</p>
            <p>And ſo Gods Promiſe we do witneſs fulfilled unto us, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will bring the Blind by a way they know not:</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God hath fulfilled this Promiſe unto thouſands, and will fulfil it in many thouſands more that yet walks in darkneſs, in the ignorance of God and his pure worſhip in his own pure Spirit: for when we were wandering up and down in our imaginations, amongſt the falſe Prophets, in their various invented Forms, which they have variouſly invented in their fallen earthly wiſdom, then we did not look to be brought to the knowledge of God by a Light or Spirit of God and Chriſt within us; for the Hireling Prieſts, and other high Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors whom we did follow for teaching, they did generally agree in telling of us that Revelation was ceaſed, and that there was no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teaching to be looked for, nor received in this Age; and they have ſaid (and publiſhed it in print unto the Nation) that they have not an infallible Spirit, as the Apoſtles and Miniſters that Chriſt ſent forth had: And while we did believe theſe their ſleepy Dreams, and lying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, thereby we were kept in Error; and ſo by theſe their Lyes they cauſed us to err, and they did labour what they could to keep us from believing in the Light; but Gods love was ſuch unto our poor diſtreſſed Souls, which was thus toſſed up and down by their falſe Doctrines, <hi>That he couſed his Light to ſhine out of darkneſs in our hearts, and to give us the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt: and this Treaſure have we in our hearts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, even in the earthen veſſels;</hi> and ſo the power and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it is of him, and not of us, and to him we give the glory and honour, for to him it is due for ever, who by his Light which he hath cauſed to ſhine in our hearts, hath given us to ſee them, and their falſe Doctrines, and falſe Worſhips and Wayes, and now he
<pb facs="tcp:106803:5"/>hath given unto us Chriſt his Son, his Covenant of Light to be our Teacher; and this is that Way which once we did not know: And God ſaid unto man, <hi>Thy Teacher ſhall no more be removed into a Corner, but thine eye ſhall ſee thy Teacher, &amp; thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee ſaying, This is the way walk in it:</hi> And we can ſay Experimentally, through Gods mercy, that that which in times paſt came behind us to call us out of Evil, when we were gone into Evil, even than ſame hath led us out of Evil; and ſo that which formerly we were turned from, we are now turned to again, ſo that which followed us and condemned us, when we did Evil, that is come before us, and leads us into thoſe things which is well-pleaſing to the Lord our God; and ſo Chriſt Jeſus the Light in us is become our Shepherd, and we do hear his Voice in us, and we do follow him, and he doth give us Peace in our inward parts which neither the Devil nor Wicked men can take from us, if we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide faithful unto him; And ſo we are ſet down under him who is the true Vine, and we are Branches in him, and ſo we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding to know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus, and this is the true God and Life Eternal; and he is our Teacher, Biſhop and High-prieſt, and Lord, and King, and we do believe that he ſhall no more be removed out of our ſight, nor hearing, but we ſhall for ever ſee him, and he ſhall Live and Reign for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; and he ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I live ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> and we know what he ſaid is true; and he ſaid, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, and he that liveth and believeth ſhall never die;</hi> and theſe things we do ſtedfaſtly believe. And as for thoſe Prieſts and Profeſſors who ſay Revelation is ceaſed, and there is no immediate teaching to be received in this Age, and thoſe that ſay they have not an infallible Spirit, as the Apoſtle had, as for thoſe that hate the Light wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, and loveth darkneſs, which is of the Devil, that cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the things of God and his Kingdom unto them; and we know that thoſe who hate the Light, and will not hearken to the Light, nor obey the Light, they can have no immediate teſtimony to bear for God unto others, and we know that there is no infallible Spirit, but the Spirit of God and Chriſt, and ſo they who do not believe in that meaſure of the Spirit of God and Chriſt which he hath placed in them to inſtruct them, they have no infallibility, but they fail of their
<pb facs="tcp:106803:5"/>Duty toward God, and one towards another, and ſo they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants, and wholy uſeleſs in the worſhip of God, <hi>For if any man have nor the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his;</hi> now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Spirit of Chriſt is infallible, it did never fail to fulfil the Will of his Father, and the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>God had ſent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, whereby they called him Father,</hi> and we do confeſs to the Glory of God that he hath ſent the ſame Spirit of his Son into our hearts, by which we can experimentally call him Father, and in and by this we have the things of God and his Kingdom revealed unto us, and are immediatly taught by this; and this is infallible, and doth not fail to lead us into all truth, if we do in Faithfulneſs follow it: and ſo it is our Comforter who love it and obey it, but it is, and will be, the Torment and Condemnation of all thoſe that hate it; So the way of the Wicked is Darkneſs, they know not at what they ſtumble, Deſtruction and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is in their way, and the way of Peace they know not.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts and Profeſſors who cry Revelation is Ceaſed, and there is no immediate Teaching to be received in this Age, and ſay that they have no Infallible Spirit.</p>
            <p>Theſe People ſay, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament is the Revealed Will of God; unto them I ſay, the Scriptures was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth by the Inſpiration of God, which gives underſtanding, and they do not ſtand and remain Open and Revealed unto any man or woman, but unto ſuch who comes into the Spirit of God and Chriſt, which is infallible; for when the Son of God opened his mouth and ſpake unto the World, he ſpoke in Parables, and they could not underſtand his words, becauſe their minds was out from that of God in them; for Chriſt told the unbelieving Jewes, that they did neither know the Scriptures nor the Power of God: And now all People whoſe minds are out from that of God in them, they can no more know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then the unbelieving Jewes could, for it is that from which they were at firſt given forth which muſt give People the true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; for Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, unto you it is given to <hi>know the Myſteries of the Kingdom,</hi> but unto others, who were in the unbelief, he did ſpeak in Parables; even the ſame words which to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſeemed Lyes and madneſs, even thoſe words was made plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; And their hearts <hi>did burn within them,</hi> when he opened unto them the Scriptures, after his Reſurrection; and <hi>I</hi> ſay the Scriptures is a book ſealed from all People, who hath the Light, and will not own
<pb facs="tcp:106803:6"/>it to be their Teacher, and they are jangling and quarrelling about the meaning of the Scriptures, and ſo are fighting and ſtriving one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother about the Shaddow and Outſide of things, and never comes to Chriſt the Subſtance; for ſaid Chriſt to the unbelieving Jewes, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think you have Eternal Life, But ye will not come unto me that you might have Life,</hi> He did not ſay you cannot come unto me, but he ſaid you will not come unto me that you might have Life; ſo Reader thou mayſt ſee they had a Stubborn will, who would not come unto Chriſt: God ſaid unto man in the daies of old, <hi>I have ſet Life and Good, before thee, and Death and Evil;</hi> and God did not, nor doth not ſay unto man, Chooſe Death that thou mayeſt dye, but he did ſay and doth ſay, chooſe Life that thou mayeſt live: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will that Prayers and Supplications be put up for all men, in as much as God would have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> and Chriſt ſaid, <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children together as a Hen gathereth her Chicken under her wings, but ye would not;</hi> and God ſaid, <hi>O Jeruſalem, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, but thy Salvation is of me, I delight not in the death of him that dyeth, but rather that every one would turn from his wickedneſs, and Live, turn you, turn you O houſe of Iſrael, why will you die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prieſts and the Profeſſors call the Scriptures the Word of God, and the Goſpel, now the Scriptures is words, and they were not in the beginning, but was given forth by holy men, many generations after God had created the Earth and all things in it, and upon it; and God ſpake words unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Read <hi>Exodus</hi> the 20; and the Apoſtles ſpake words in the Word and Power of the Lord, which was in the beginning before man was, or words either; and <hi>whoſoever ſhall add unto the words of this Propheſic,</hi> ſaid <hi>John,</hi> in his <hi>Revelations, &amp;c.</hi> So the Scriptures is words, and not the Word, <hi>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; By him was all things made, in him was Life and that Life was the Light of men; And this is that Eternal and Ingraffted Word, which is able to ſave the ſouls</hi> of all that do believe in it; The Prophet hid it in his heart, leſt he ſhould ſin againſt God, and it was as a Fire ſhut up in the Prophets bones, and it was and is as a Fire, Hammer, and Sword, and Ax, to cut down the Devil and his Works in the heart of man where it is received, and no man or woman need ſay, <hi>who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, to fetch Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to fetch Chriſt up from vexeath, or who
<pb facs="tcp:106803:6"/>ſhall go beyond the Sea to fetch Chriſt unto us: for, behold, the Word is nigh thee, in thy heart, and in thy mouth, that thou may hear it, and do it;</hi> and the four Books of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> which the Prieſts and Profeſſors calls the Goſpel, is not the Goſpel; for it is but about Sixteen hundred years ago ſince thoſe Books were written: But the Goſpel was Preached unto <hi>Abraham</hi> many Generations before thoſe Books were written, and the Goſpel is Everlaſting; an <hi>Angel did flee thorough the midſt of Heaven, having the Everlaſting Goſpel to Preach;</hi> That which is Everlaſting is without beginning and without end; now the Apoſtle ſaid that the Goſpel which he did Preach it was <hi>the Power of God;</hi> now the Power of God is Everlaſting, without beginning and without end; but books, and words, and writings, had a beginning and may have an end, ſo is not the Everlaſting Goſpel, and there is no Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of God but one, and that one Goſpel <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, and he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not from man, neither was he taught it by man, but by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt, and he ſaid, <hi>If any man Preach unto you any other Goſpel let him be accurſed,</hi> So Reader, that Goſpel which we Preach, we have not received it from man, nor from books, nor from writings, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt in us; and what we have felt, and ſeen, and taſted, and handled of the Word of Life, Spiritually, Inwardly, theſe things declare we unto People, that they might believe in God the Father who is Light, and in Chriſt his Son who is Light, and that they in the Father and the Son might have Fellowſhip with us: and ſo Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we have Revelation among us, and immediate Teaching by the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus in us; and as many as walk according to this Rule, <hi>Peace be unto them;</hi> for thoſe are the Children of God, even thoſe who are led by the Spirit of God, which never did fail to bring forth Righteouſneſs in thoſe that did Obey it: And ſo Reader, the Prieſts and Profeſſors, who deny Revelation, and immediate Teaching, and an infallible Spirit, they can ſpeak nothing of certainty concerning God and his Kingdom, and things pertaining to the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but what they do ſpeak is their imaginations and dreams; ſo it is not for People to truſt unto them for Teaching, for their mouths muſt be ſtopped, which was never yet opened by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, the Power of God from Heaven, and they are to come and learn in Silence of the Light in their own Conſciences, untill it hath taught them the Knowledg of God, and until they come to know the Light to be infallible, and the onely true Teacher.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106803:7"/>
            <p>And now, Reader, I ſay keep low in thy mind in the Reading of this following Teſtimony, and if thou do find ſomething ſpoken that thou cannot yet wholy joyn withall, labour to keep in the Patience, and keep out of Fretting, and be not Raſh; for thou wilt find things that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſharply reproved, in Perſons of all ſorts, without reſpect of perſons; and it was the manner of the true Prophets, and Miniſters, and Apoſtles of Chriſt, and of Chriſt himſelf, to reprove the falſe Prophets ſharply, and alſo to Reprove Wicked, Prophane, Ungodly Men, and Women ſharply, to the end that they might Repent, and forſake the evil of their waies.</p>
            <p>But it hath been the manner of the falſe Prophets, whom God never ſent, to Daub and flatter and Propheſie Lyes unto People, and to ſpeak Peace unto People in their ſins; and Wo from the Lord God, is coming upon thoſe Teachers, who is making it their Buſineſs to Preach up ſin for term of life, and to Promiſe unto People Peace in their ſins; <hi>Your Sins hath ſeperated between you and me ſaith the Lord, Your ſins hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden good things from you,</hi> and no man or woman can be joyned to God in their ſins, and no <hi>unclean thing</hi> can enter the Kingdom of God, and as the Tree falleth ſo it lyeth, there is no Repentance in the Grave: So People muſt either witneſs Clenſing and Freedom from ſin, before they go out of the Body, or elſe they will never be made clean.</p>
            <p>God did give the Apoſtles Gifts, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Church, which was Chriſts Body, until all come unto the meaſure of the Stature of Chriſt, unto a Perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtle did bid People caſt off every weight, and burden, and the ſin that did ſo eaſily beſet them, that ſo they might run the Race that was ſet before them, and they laboured that they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every man <hi>Perfect in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and the Miniſters which Chriſt doth ſend forth in this Age, their Labour is to bring People into Chriſt Gods Power, that they may ſit down in Him, in the heavenly Peace, in him to Reign over ſin, and him that is the Author of ſin, which is the Devil; and this the Lord hath already done for a little Remnant, and he will certainly do it for many Thouſands more; To him be all Honour, Glory; Dominion and Praiſes both now and for evermore, Amen; even ſo Amen, ſaith my Soul.</p>

Friends, theſe things are of great weight for you to conſider, while you have a little time, and do not content your ſelves with a bare profeſſion of God and Chriſt without you, at a diſtance from you, and from thence to draw a vain and dead hope that it will be well with you in the World to come; for I ſay, <hi>If ye die in your ſins, whither he goeth ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come;</hi> and in dear love I ſay unto you, thoſe ſayings of his will certainly be fulfilled upon you, as they were fulfilled upon the unbelieving Jews, if you do not believe in, and obey the Light wherewith he hath enlightned you: For, I ſay, conſider the Jews, they looked for the coming of the Meſſiah, becauſe they had the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other Prophets, who propheſied of his coming, yet when he was come they would not believe that it was he, Chriſt; but when he did the Works that no other could do, then they ſaid he had a Devil, and by <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> the Prince of Devils he caſt out Devils: Now conſider, how came they to be thus deceived, and thus to judge of him, ſeeing they had the Prophets Writings which foretold of his coming: Well, Friends, this I ſay, they were expecting him to come in an other manner then he did come; for they reading that he ſhould be a King and Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they looked for him to come in great pomp and dignity outwardly; but when he came,<note place="margin">Mark 6.3.</note> he came much contrary to their thoughts, and expectations, and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for he was ſuppoſed by them to be <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenters ſon, a man of low eſteem amongſt them, and ſo they diſpiſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his low Appearance, which was ſo far contrary to what they had imagined concerning his coming, and ſo they would not have him to rule over them, but they ſlew him, ſo they loſt the benefit of his coming, and ſo died in their ſins, and ſo was ſhut out of the Kingdom of God, becauſe of their unbelief; ſo here was their Miſery, they would not receive him, becauſe he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106803:9"/>came not according as they had imagined he ſhould come: Now, Friends, to come nearer to your condition, I ſhall write as the Spirit of the Lord ſhall move me, which dwelleth in my heart; Friends, conſider, What is the reaſon that you will not own the Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened you, and all people, to be a ſufficient Teacher, and Ordinance for Salvation unto you, and all people, and to bring you, and all people unto God (out of ſin) if you and they did believe in it, and obey it? I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Is it not becauſe you have read the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles Writings with the ſame dark minds, in unbelief, that the Jews did read the Prophets Writings, and in the Darkneſs which you have loved a great deal more then the Light, you have imagined that Chriſt would ſhew himſelf unto you ſome other way then by his Light in your Conſciences? It hath been a very hatefull thing unto many of you Profeſſors to hear us exhort you to turn unto the Light within, and becauſe we told you that was the Ordinance of God for Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth, according to the words of the Prophet, who propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Power of his coming,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.5.6, 7, 8, 22.</note> who ſaid, <hi>I will give him for a Light unto the Gentiles, and Leader to his People, to be his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Ends of the Earth;</hi> and when we have born our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony amongſt you concerning this Light, according to the plain words of the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles laid down in the holy Scriptures, and in the brokenneſs of our hearts have in much love unto you, declared our own experience of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous opperation of this Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned us, and what Chriſt the Light had done for our Souls, ſince we in his Light believed: and when we thus laboured in the Love of God to do you good, in perſwading you to believe in the Light wherewith he hath enlightened you, that ſo you might have come to have felt the vertue and power of it in your own hearts, for your own everlaſting good: then many of you have rejected our Teſtimony, and hath ſhamefully entreated us, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded us evil for good, and you have hated this Light, and cried, Away with this Light, and alſo with thoſe that have been moved of the Lord God to bear witneſs unto this Light, <hi>Which is the Trve Light which hath Enlightened every one that is come into the World,</hi> as the Jews cried away with Chriſt, when they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106803:9"/>imagined he had been <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenters ſon,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4, 5, &amp;c. to 16.</note> and ſo the Light is judged by your Carnal Wiſdom and Reaſon to be too low a thing to ſtoop unto; and the Jews in their Carnal Wiſdom and Reaſon judged Chriſt when he was come, not to be worthy or fit to be a King over them, becauſe they looked upon him to be a Carpenters ſon, a man inferiour unto many of them as they imagined; and ſo they hated him, and ſlew him. And ſo now all you Profeſſors, who have been, and yet are haters of the Light, and cryeth away with it, and accounts it too low a thing for you to ſtoop unto, you are deceived, Chriſt will not ſhew himſelf unto you any other way, but by the meaſure of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wherewith he hath Enlightened you; it is written, <hi>No man knows the things of God but the Spirit of God;</hi> but many of you Profeſſors will not believe that the Light wherewith Chriſt hath Enlightened you, is of power and ſufficiency to bring you to God, out of ſin; and ſo to this day you have not the Benefit of Chriſts coming, but you are ſtill in your ſins, committing them, and pleading that you muſt do ſo while you are in the Earthly Tabernacle: And ſo are you not Rebellious Children, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the Light, Grace and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt which he hath placed in you to Inſtruct you? And do not you as plainly Crucifie, and do Diſpite unto the Opperation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Light and Grace of Chriſt in your Inwards Parts, as the Jews did unto the Veſſel which they imagined to be <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenters ſon? So, conſider of theſe things ſoberly, in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the fear of the Lord God, and be not angry at me for writing thus in plainneſs unto you; for know you all, aſſuredly, that it is the Love of God in my heart unto you, that conſtrains me to write thus in plainneſs unto you; ſo while you have a little time prize it, and while you have a ſence and feeling of the Light, Grace and Spirit of Chriſt in your inward parts checking and condemning you when you do Evil, believe you all in it, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto it give up; and when it condemns you for Evil, which you have already done, then own its Judgments, for its Judgments are juſt and true; and when it letteth you ſee Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations unto Sin, before you have conſented unto the Tempter, or done the Evil he tempteth you unto, then love it, and let your minds be cloſely joyned unto it, and then it will preſerve

            <p>I ſay in Coolneſs and true Moderation, in the Fear of the Lord God conſider, and take diligent notice of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Doctrine to the Saints, <hi>Know this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that the Scriptures came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God gave them forth as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, (or Ghoſt:)</hi> So I ſay, in the Fear of the Lord God take notice, there were Holy men before there were Holy Scriptures, and it was the Holy Spirit, or Light of God and Chriſt in men that made men holy, and was their Guide and their Rule, by which they were led and guided to do thoſe things which did pleaſe the Lord God, before there was any outward Writing or Printing. <hi>Abel</hi> was a Righteous man, and was beloved of God, and was Guided and Ruled by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God within him, before any part of the Bible was written; and <hi>Abel</hi> offered unto the Lord, and the Lord accepted of his Offering; but <hi>Cain</hi> was a wicked man, and a Vagabond, for he was wandered and ravened from the Spirit of God within him; and when he was ravened and wandered from the Spirit of God within him, and his Soul had no habitation in God, but was a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106803:19"/>and his Soul delighted in Evil,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. from verſ. 5, to 17.</note> then in that ſtate he offered unto the Lord God, but the Lord God did not accept of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, no, God took no pleaſure at all in it, becauſe he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened from the Spirit or Light of God within him, and was wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then when <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering was rejected, then <hi>Cain</hi> was wroth, and his countenance fell; and the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Cain, Why art thou Wroth? and why is thy Countenance faln, if thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? but if thou doeſt evil, ſin lieth at thy door:</hi> But <hi>Cain,</hi> who was full of wrath, becauſe he was reproved, and his Offering not accepted, he in his wrath roſe up againſt his righteous Brother, whom God loved, and whoſe Offering God accepted, and he ſlew his righteous Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Brothers works were righteous, and his own were wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Lord God curſed <hi>Cain</hi> for ſhedding innocent blood; and <hi>Cain</hi> when he was ravined from the Spirit of God within him, and had ſhed innocent blood, he became great in the Earth, and builded a City; and although he had a City upon Earth, yet he was a Vagabond, becauſe he was wandered and ravened from the Spirit of God within him, for his Soul had no habitation in God, but the Wrath of God did abide upon him. And now all ye Prieſts and People, and Profeſſors of all ſorts, who have been, or are, or deſire to be Perſecutors of thoſe whom the Lord God loveth, and taketh pleaſure in, take notice of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that great and firſt Perſecutor about Religion, and all of you repent, and give over perſecuting people for the exerciſe of their Conſciences towards God, <hi>Or elſe you will undo your ſelves, The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it;</hi> for whoſoever perſecutes any man, for the exerciſe of his Conſcience towards God, they are of the ſame Spirit with <hi>Cain,</hi> and their Reward will be the ſame with his, if they do not give over perſecuting, and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent; for there ought none to exerciſe Authority over the Conſciences of men and women but the Lord God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, (who are one,) for it is Gods Right only to Rule in and over the Conſciences of people; and what man or men ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon the Face of the whole Earth, who doth take upon him, or them, to lay a yoke upon the Conſciences of people, to limit people from a Worſhip into which they are already led by the Spirit of the Lord God, ſuch, who ſo doth, they do and will

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106803:23"/>of Chriſt, he told the Saints,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19</note> that they had <hi>a moro ſure Word of Propheſie,</hi> (then that which was heard in the Mount) <hi>whereunto they did well if they took heed, us unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Now People take notice, that the dark place where the Light did ſhine, which people was to take heed unto, was within people; for, ſaid he, you do well that you take heed unto the Light which ſhineth in the dark place, until the day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts; ſo when they did believe in the Light, and take heed unto the Light, then the day did dawn in their hearts; but when they did not believe in the Light, nor take heed unto it, then the thick night of darkneſs was in and over their hearts, <hi>For God called the Light Day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.7. &amp; verſ. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and the Darkneſs he called Night;</hi> ſo all who do evil they do it in the Night, in the Darkneſs, when they are ravined from the Light, the free Gift of God within them: but <hi>Peter,</hi> the Miniſter of Chriſt, he brought people to the Light of the free Gift of God in them; and ſo we the Servants and Miniſters of Chriſt, we do direct peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Light and Grace of God in them, which is Gods Gift unto them to profit withal; and we the Servants of Chriſt do ſpeak that freely unto people, which we have freely and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately received from the Lord God to ſpeak unto them, and it doth not coſt us any Money, for the Gift of God cannot be bought nor ſold for Money; for <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the Sorcerer, when he perceived the Gift and Power of God which was with <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Miniſters of Chriſt, he would have given them Money that he might have had the ſome Power, but <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Thy Money periſh with thee, thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter, becauſe thou haſt thought that the Gift of God might be bought for Money;</hi> ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt in former Ages did not ſell the Gift which God had given them for Money, but judged and reproved <hi>Simon,</hi> who would have given them Money for the Gift of God: And the Servants or Miniſters, now at this day, who have received a Gift from God, and a Command from God to ſpeak unto people, they do not ſell the Gift which God hath given unto them for Money, nor any other Earthly thing, nor their Words which they do ſpeak from the Gift or Spirit of God within them, they do not ſell for Money, nor for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106803:24"/>any Earthly thing; and ſo in this they are like unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt in the Ages paſt: and as the Miniſters of Chriſt, in the Ages paſt, did direct people to the Light within, the Grace within,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.1, 2, &amp;c. to verſe 13.</note> the Spirit within, the Word within, and the Anointing within, which was to guide them and lead them into all Truth; ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt in this Age doth direct people to the Light within, Grace within, Spirit within, Anointing within, and the Word within,<note place="margin">Deut. 30.14.</note> which was in the Beginning, that they may hear it in their own hearts, and be obedient unto it: And as the Miniſters of Chriſt in former Ages lived a Godlike, Sober, and Holy life, and lived in the good they exhorted others to come into, and alſo lived out of the evil that they reproved others for; ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt at this day, by the ſame Spirit of God within them, are kept in a holy Godlike life, and they are in the good they exhort others to come into, and they live out of the evil that they reprove others for, and in this they are like unto the Miniſters of Chriſt in the former Age: and the Miniſters of Chriſt, now in this Age, are good examples unto thoſe people unto whom they preach the Goſpel, and unto all people who ſees them, Glory, yea, glory to the Lord God for ever, for it is his Work, and it glorifies him, and he is worthy for ever, even ſo Amen for ever. But the Hirelings, whom God never ſent, nor commanded to preach, who run and intrude themſelves to be Teachers for Hire, for their Belleys, they ſay unto their Followers, be not proud, and they themſelves are proud; and they ſay unto their Followers, be not covetous, and they themſelves are the moſt coveteous men that be upon the Earth, their Fruits doth make them manifeſt; for they do make it their frequent practice to force Wages from thoſe they do no work for; and I do not know any Tradeſman in this Nation, of any other Trade, that will demand, or force Wages from thoſe they do no work for, but only the Hireling Prieſts, and the Officers of that bad Trade: And the Hirelings ſaith, be not Envious, and they themſelves are Envious, and ſo they are out of the good they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort others to come into, and they are in the evil that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove others for, and ſo their Doctrine is of no Authority, and it is not worth heeding; for it hath no power in it to kill Sin, nor to caſt him out of people, who is the Power, and Author, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106803:24"/>Root of Sin, which is the Devil; and ſo they are Hypocrites who judgeth their Followers for doing evil, and they themſelves are doing the ſame evil: for Chriſt ſaid that he was a Hypocrite who ſaid unto his Brother, Let me pull the Moat one of thine Eye, and he had not firſt pulled the Beam out of his own Eye;<note place="margin">Mat. 7.3, 4, 5.</note> and Chriſt ſaid he was a Hypocrite who judged another,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.1, 2, 3.</note> and acted the ſame things himſelf: And this I ſay in the Name and Power of the Lord God, that there is many thouſands of thoſe people who follows the Hireling Prieſts, who are more naturally honeſt, and are of a better underſtanding to receive the things of the the Spirit of God, then the Hireling Prieſts who are their Teachers; but God will gather them out from them, and will teach them himſelf, freely, by his own Spirit in their own hearts: Some of the Hireling Prieſts have been heard to ſay, to their Followers, do not as we do, but do as we ſay; now this is clearly contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, who ſaid unto them that followed him, <hi>Walk as you have us for an Example, and follow us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1. Phil. 5.17, 18, 19. 1 Theſſ. 1.6, 7. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>as we follow Chriſt,</hi> (ſpeaking of himſef and the reſt of the Miniſters of Chriſt) he did not bid them do as he ſaid, and not as he did, for he had no need to ſay ſo, for his Converſation and Doctrine was agreeable: The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he writ unto the Elders, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Feed the Flock of God which are amongſt you, not taking the Overſight thereof by Conſtraint, but willingly;</hi> let all people that reads take notice of thoſe words, the Elders were not to take the Overſight of the Flock, by conſtraint but willingly; now the reaſon why <hi>Peter</hi> did write theſe words unto them, was, becauſe there was not any outward Gift or Reward to be given unto them, for their Feeding and taking Care for the Flock of God, for it was a Spiritual Work, and it was to have a Spiritual Reward; ſo leſt any, through the temptation of the Enemy of their Souls, ſhould have ſtriven to put that from them, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, <hi>Peter</hi> warned them; then the next following words are theſe, <hi>Not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</hi> now filthy lucre, is much Earthly gain ill gotten, but the Elders were not to take the overſight of the Flock of God for outward gain, but as being of a ready mind, and a willing mind to ſerve God in what he required of them, yea, to feed his Sheep with the Bread of Life, which God gave unto them; and the Elders were not to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106803:25"/>be Lords over Gods Flock, which he had made them Overſeers of, but they were to be Examples to the Flock, and they were good Examples to the Flock, and they did not ſay as ſome of the Hirelings have ſaid, Do as we ſay, and not as we do, for they had no need to ſay ſo, for their Converſation and Doctrine was agreeable, and ſo is the Doctrine and Converſation of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miniſters of Chriſt in this Age, Glory to the Lord God for ever.</p>
            <p>Now if there were a young Prieſt that had learned his Trade at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who wanted a place to ſet up his Trade in, if one ſhould come unto him, and tell him of three or four places, one of One hundred pounds by the year, and another of Two, &amp; another of Three, and another of Four, and bid him chuſe which of thoſe he would go unto, one may eaſily know which he would chuſe, for he would be where he could get moſt with his Trade, and he need not be conſtrained to go unto a Pariſh where he might have Four hundred pounds in the year for his Hire,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.9.</note> but he would make great haſt to get unto it, leſt another of his own Trade ſhould get it before him; and this is contrary to thoſe Miniſters which Chriſt ſent forth. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a Tentmaker, when he was a Miniſter of the Goſpel, laboured with his own hands, and adminiſtred unto his own neceſſities, that he might make the Goſpel without charge; and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the reſt of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſome were Fiſher-men, and ſome of other callings, and they Laboured with their hands, yet they had power to eat and to drink for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of their Bodies, when they did travel up and down among the Saints who were gathered by their Miniſtry; but they were often in Hunger, and Cold, and Faſtings, and Peril by Sea and Land; and were often whipped, ſtocked, and impriſoned; and they had not a Pariſh, and a hundred pound in the year, and an outward Law to guard them, as the Hireling Prieſts have.</p>
            <p>And now all ye Magiſtrates, both high and low, and all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in what Form of Religion ſoever, think it not ſtrange that we cannot come unto the Steeple-houſe, and hear your Prieſt; Preach and Pray, ſeeing that they are ſo far different from the Miniſters of Chriſt, every way; ſo that they are no more like

            <p>And now all Magiſtrates and People, of what form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſoever, who profeſs the Scriptures to be your Rule, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the Light, Spirit and Grace of God within you, which convinceth you of Sin, to be a ſufficient Guide, of it ſelf, to lead you out of Sin, whether you be ſuch as own thoſe Prieſts and their Practice, which I have written ſomething in ſhort againſt, or whether you be ſuch as do deny them, and are gathered into ſome other Form differing from them, if you ſet the Scriptures in the Place of the Spirit of God, which made men holy before any Scriptures were written, and from which the holy men ſpake forth the holy Scriptures, then with you is my controverſie on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Lord my God.</p>
            <p>So come to your Tryal, and be you tryed by that which you call your own Rule, the Holy Scriptures, which was given forth from and by the Holy Spirit; ſo the Holy Spirit of God is the Original of the Holy Scriptures; therefore I, and all my faithfull Brethren and Siſters do know them, and love them, and believe them.</p>

You that perſecutes your Neighbours, becauſe they will not be of your Religion, and come to your Steeple-houſes, and hear your Hireling Prieſts, and pay them Tythes, which was never demanded by any of Chriſt's Miniſters; no, the Miniſters and Apoſtles of Chriſt did never demand nor receive any Tythes at all, for the Tythes were ordained for the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Joh. 4.20, &amp;c. to ver. 27.</note> and that was many hundred years ago, and the Scriptures of Truth, which the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> do call their Rule, do prove what I have written concerning this thing.</p>
            <p>And O ye Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> you have no command from God to take Tythes, and therefore you have no right to Tythes; and there is a People of a tender Conſcience in this Nation, whom you in ſcorn call Quakers, God hath opened their Eyes, and they ſee and know you have no right to Tythes; and therefore in obedience unto Chriſt Jeſus the Everlaſting High-Prieſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16, 17.</note> who hath ended the outward Temple, and outward Prieſts, and Law, and Tythes, they have with-holden their own from you,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> and durſt not give you any Tythes; for if they had, then they had provoked the Lord God unto wrath againſt them; and for this their tender obedience unto their God, you have perſecuted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them, your Neighbours unto death; and thus you have brought innocent blood upon your ſelves, for which you muſt drink deep of the Cup of Gods fierce Indignation;<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.25, 26.</note> and you do ſtill continue your Cruelty, in impriſoning the Bodies, and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goods of thoſe your Neighbours, and you have not yet repented of thoſe your grievous Sins, neither do you ſeek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for thoſe your grievous Sins; for if you were ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for what you have done, in thoſe things which you have done, then you would give over ſo doing; but the moſt of you, who

            <p>Therefore I ſay unto you all, turn in your minds unto the Eternal true Light wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened you all, and if you love it, it will work repentance in your hearts, and if you give up your minds to be led by it, it will lead you out of all deceit, and double dealing, and if you love it, and in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs follow and obey it, it will lead you to love your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as your ſelves; and then, I am ſure, you neither can, nor will, nor dare cheat nor defraud them, but then you will do unto them, as you would they ſhould do unto you; and I am ſure, there is no man that would be cheated nor defrauded by any man that he deals withal, in buying, and ſelling, and exchanging Gods good Creatures; and ſo let every man and woman come to the Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened them, and as they would have none to cheat nor defraud them, the Light of Chriſt will not ſuffer them to cheat, nor deceive, nor defraud any man, or woman, or child whatſoever, if they love it, and in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs follow it; for the Light is the Spirit of Truth, which leadeth into all Truth all thoſe that believe in it, and in faithfulneſs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; and ſo if all people would come unto the Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath enlightened them, then it would lead them all to deal juſtly, plainly, truly and uprightly one with another.</p>
            <p>But, alas, this pure Light and Spirit in peoples Conſciences is not loved, nor heeded, nor believed, nor obeyed by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men and women, who doth profeſs God and Chriſt in words, and calls the Scripture their Rule; and that is the reaſon that there is ſo much cheating and defrauding amongſt people in buying, and ſelling, and exchanging of Gods good Creatures; and that is the cauſe that there is ſo much robbing and ſtealing Gods good Creatures one from another; and that is the cauſe there is ſo much hanging and killing one another about Gods good Creatures; and that is the cauſe that there is ſo much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106803:29"/>hanging, and burning, and killing one another about Religion, even becauſe people do not believe in, and obey the Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God hath enlightened them; and until the inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> and all Nations, come unto the Light wherewith Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God hath enlightened every one that is come into the World, and believe in, and obey it, they will never come to be eſtabliſhed in Peace, nor to have the Bleſſing of God, nor to inherit the Kingdom of God: but while they are Rebellious againſt the Light of Chriſt in them, there will come Judgments and Plagues one after another, and there ſhall be no peace to the Wicked, who continue in Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened them, neither in this World, nor in that which is to come: and theſe are the words of Truth from the Lord God, unto all people, which ſhall ſtand a Witneſs for the Lord God againſt all who do continue in Rebellion againſt the Light; and I do declare, in the Name of the Lord God, that it is the great Miſery of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> and all other Nations whatſoever, that they do not believe in the Light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened every one that is come into the World; for if all people, in all Nations, would come to the Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath enlightened them, which convinceth them of Sin, then the Light would reconcile all differences amongſt them, yea, it would reconcile them all together, and it would make them of one heart, and of one mind; but they being out from the Light, they are of many minds, and they are ſtriving one with another who ſhall be the greateſt; and they are warring one with another, and killing one another for Earthly Crowns, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honour, and Earthly Riches, and alſo about their Idolatrous Worſhip, and their many Babiloniſh Religions: Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.1, &amp;c. to ver. 11.</note>

            <p>IT is ſaid by many ignorant people, who uſe to plead for Sin, That the Righteouſeſt man that is upon the Earth, doth Sin ſeven times a day; now, I ſay, they do abuſe and wreſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for there is no ſuch word in all the Bible, called the Old and New Teſtament: But in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 24. verſ. 15, and 16. thus it is written, <hi>Lay not in wait, O wicked Man, againſt the Dwelling of the Righteous, ſpoil not his Reſting-place: For a Juſt Man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth again; but the Wicked fall into Miſchief:</hi> Now [mark] the Juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth again; now, I ſay, here is neither <hi>Sin,</hi> nor <hi>Day</hi> ſpoken of; but the Wicked fall into Miſchief: now conſider, to do Miſchief, is to do Evil, and to do Evil, is Sin; but the Juſt man did not fall into Miſchief, and ſo he did not fall into Sin.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold,</hi> who was men that did play upon Inſtruments of Muſick, in the ſame wiſdom in which the Poets do make ungodly Ballads, they made a Song which they called <hi>The Humble Complaint of a Sinner,</hi> and in that Song of theirs there is ſome ſuch like words, as the Juſt man ſinneth ſeven times a day; but thoſe words of theirs are not to be heeded, for they had them not out of the Holy Scriptures, but they are their own invented Lyes.</p>
            <p>Many other places of the Holy Scriptures are wreſted after this manner by thoſe who have not believed in the Light, who pleads for Sin; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> according unto the wiſdom given unto him, in all his Epiſtles he did write things hard to be underſtood, which they that were unlearned and unſtable did wreſt, as alſo they did the other Scriptures, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; this is <hi>Peters</hi> Teſtimony, who was a Fiſherman, and knew not Letters, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. So all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take notice, that it was not becauſe they wanted Greek, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106803:35"/>and Latine, that they wreſted <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, and the other Scriptures to their own deſtruction, but it was becauſe they were not come to believe in that meaſure of the Spirit wherewith Chriſt had enlightened them: for from the Spirit of God was the holy Scriptures given forth, and there is none can come to know them, and underſtand them, until they come to believe in, and obey that meaſure of God in themſelves, which is one with that from which the holy Scriptures was given forth; and when people come to believe in that, and learn of that, then God by that will open their underſtandings to know and rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the holy Scriptures, and until then people can neither know, nor underſtand them aright: for while people are out from that of God in them, they one imagine one thing from the Scriptures, and another imagineth another thing from the ſame part of the Scripture; and one ſaith it meaneth thus, and another he ſaith, nay, but it meaneth thus, and ſo they are bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their imaginations about the holy Scriptures: one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is the meaning, and another ſaying, that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo every one builds his Religion according to his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and ſo every one that hath not believed in the Light, they are wreſting of the holy Scriptures, and with their dark meanings are pleading Scripture, and would fain prove by the holy Scriptures that theirs is the true Religion; and as Chriſt ſaid it ſhould be, ſo it is come to paſs, one ſaith, Lo, here is Chriſt, and another ſaith, Lo, there is Chriſt: but Chriſt ſaid unto the Saints, <hi>Go not forth:</hi> now the Saints minds were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in unto the Light, and that gave them to know the holy Scriptures, and alſo to know the falſe Prophets who led peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds out from that of God in them; for the Way of God is to be known within, and he that leads people from that of God in them, into outward obſervations, he is a Deceiver and an Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> had Greek, Hebrew, and Latine, and he could not open the Scriptures by it, nor know the Son of God by it, but he judged him to die, and when he was to be Crucified, he did write a Superſcription in Greek, Hebrew, and Latine Letters, and ſet it over Chriſts head: and the perſecuting Jews had Greek, Hebrew, and Latine, for they came and did read the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106803:35"/>which <hi>Pilate</hi> had written, but they could not open the Scriptures with their Greek, Hebrew, and Latine, though they had all the Prophets Writings who propheſied of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of the Place where he was to be born, yet they could not underſtand the Prophets words with all their Greek, Hebrew, and Latine, all their Earthly wiſdom and Learning was to ſhort, and to ſhallow to underſtand thoſe Heavenly things: and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not believed in the Light of Chriſt in them, they were dark and blind Spiritually, and could not know, nor underſtand the Scriptures, nor know Chriſt when he was come, but they ſaid he had a Devil, and was Mad: but had they come to that of God in them, that would have given them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, and the knowledge that he was the Son of God: for he told them, that the <hi>Kingdom of God did not come with outward obſervation, as Lo here, or Lo there,</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106803:36"/>minded men and women. But <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the reſt of the Fiſhermen, who knew not Letters, they were men of more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and low Spirits then the Jews were, who had Greek, Hebrew, and Latine; for they were proud becauſe of their Tongues and Natural Learning, as our Engliſh Prieſts and Doctors are; and ours can no more know Chriſt, and the holy Scriptures by their Greek, Hebrew, and Latine, and Earthly Wiſdom, then <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Jews could: but <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the reſt of the Fiſhermen, they were low mean men, as to the outward, they did not diſpiſe Chriſt becauſe of his low Appearance outwardly, but they did believe in him, and loved him, and did forſake their Nets, and followed him, and in them God did take delight, and he did reveal Great and Mighty things unto them, which was hid from <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Jews, who had Greek, Hebrew, and Latine.</p>
            <p>And now, I ſay unto all people, God is riſing to confound the Wiſdom of all the Earthly Wiſe men, who are proud of Greek, Hebrew, and Latine, and who diſpiſe their Neighbours, who have it not, and all their Earthly Wiſdom, in which they have boaſted and exalted themſelves, will the Lord God make to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as it is, Fooliſhneſs, and he will abaſe proud <hi>Haman</hi> in this the day of his Mighty Power; yea, he will bring down the Mighty, and he will exalt them of a low degree; yea, this is the Lord God doing, that no fleſh may glory.</p>
            <p>And now unto all people in tender Love I ſay, turn in your minds unto the Manifeſtation of the Spirit and Light of Chriſt, which is given unto you to profit withal, that it may give you the Knowledg of God, whom to know is Eternal Life, and that it may open the holy Scriptures unto your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: For it is written, <hi>No man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God.</hi> And now, Oh all ye Profeſſors, in all Forms, I charge you in the Name and Power of the Lord God, do not give your dark meanings unto the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for they are of no private interpretation; and remember how you uſe to take <hi>Pauls</hi> words in his Epiſtles, which are too hard for you to underſtand, until you come unto the Light, and learn of it: I ſay, remember how you uſe to take his words to plead for Sin for term of Life; but come to the Light of Chriſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106803:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>in you all, and Learn of it and it will ſtop your Mouthes, and not ſuffer you to open them to plead for Sin, which is the work of the Devil: I charge you, in the Name of the Lord God, do not wreſt the holy Scriptures to plead for your Pride, and Covetouſneſs, and Envy, and other Abominations which you live in, and delight in; for Wo will come upon all that are covered and not with the Spirit of the Lord God; and no other covering will ſtand you in ſtead in the day when you muſt all receive a Reward according to the Deeds done in the Body, whether they be good or evil. Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. from Verſe 1, to 23.</p>
            <p>And now I have cleared my Conſcience in obedience unto the Lord God, and I reſt in peace; and whether you will hear, or forbear, I am clear.</p>
